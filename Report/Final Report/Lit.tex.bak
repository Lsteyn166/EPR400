In this section of the report a brief overview of the existing research that is relevant to this project will be given, as well as a short discussion on how this existing research will be used to aid in the design of a five legged holonomic robot during the course of this project.
\subsubsection{Background and context}
Legged vehicles are preferred to wheeled vehicles for exploration and rescue in remote areas because of their ability to cross rough terrain quickly with a severely reduced risk of getting stuck. The price to pay for this superior drive-train is far more complex electronics and movement algorithms \cite{Hidayat:Autonomous}. Instead of just driving the wheel motors and steering, each limb actuator of each leg has to be controlled to move to a calculated position. While traditional wheeled vehicles use DC motors for locomotion, legged vehicles would normally make use of stepper motors, servo motors or DC motors with rotational feedback. All of these options significantly complicates the vehicle drivetrain in both electronic hardware and software. The advantage of legged vehicles in this case is that no extra mechanical or electronic systems are required for the steering of the robot, it is usually integrated in the software for the drivetrain\\ 

%IK
Inverse kinematics is the mathematical process used to calculate the required angles of the limbs of a structure to reach a specific set of coordinates. This is the functional inverse of the forward kinematic process. This is the process of using known angles for bends in an articulated design such as a robotic leg or arm and finding the Cartesian coordinates of any of the segments, as a result of the angles originally used. The preferred method, however is to plan to move to a known Cartesian coordinate point and calculate the bend angles required to reach this point. In the paper \cite{Oh:Analytic}, a method is discussed for solving the inverse kinematic equations involved in a seven degrees of freedom robotic arm. This method takes into account specified minimum and maximum values for each actuator and degree of freedom in order to avoid self-collision. This is an important aspect to take into account while doing the calculations since the mathematical equations do not take the physical properties of any of the limbs of their actuators into account. The entire model is simplified to lines and points in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. One of the most important properties that need to be adhered to manually is the angular limits of any joint. This could be because of physical construction where the segments can only bend up to a point, or because of limits inherent to the actuator. Servo motors often have a limited range of motion, for example 180 degrees.\\

%Sine pattern
To obtain the Cartesian coordinates desired at any given time, the method described in \cite{Hidayat:Autonomous}, namely Sine pattern methods is used. In \cite{Hidayat:Autonomous}, the method was applied to a quadruped robot. Although the robot used in the paper had only four legs, it is possible to adapt this method to any number of legs. Adaptation is especially required for an odd number of legs because the method relies on the symmetry of a quadruped robot to schedule the lifting of the legs.\\

%Motion planning
In the conference paper \cite{Jain:Odometry}, motion planning of omnidirectional robots is discussed and a sophisticated, yet simple and efficient method of route planning is proposed. This method is based on vehicles that use three omnidirectional wheels in combination to form a resultant force vector in the desired direction. These type of vehicles differ largely in terms of locomotion when compared to the holonomic legged design used in this project, but there are a few key similarities. Both these designs can move holonomically, therefore they have the ability to move in a straight line while rotating, move in an arc without rotating, or any combination of the two.\\

%Sensors
A team from Instituto Tecnologico de la Laguna in Mexico designed a hexapod robot \cite{Ollervides:Navigation} similar to the robot designed in this project. The purpose of the hexapod was to investigate its potential for use in exploration of areas that are hard to reach by any commonly used means of transportation. Legged vehicles are more suited to cross rough terrain, but rough terrain complicates the design of the drive-train. In applications where the surface is smooth, or close to smooth, open loop control can be applied where the leg is simply moved to the desired position and it is assumed by the designer that the robot foot is making contact with the ground at this point, therefore supporting part of the distributed robot weight. When the robot is crossing rough terrain, where the surface consists of mainly bumps and holes, this assumption could be false. In such a scenario, the robot could lift a leg while under the impression that its weight is being supported by the other legs. If this is not the case, the robot could fall over and possibly damage itself or be unable to rectify itself.\\

To avoid this problem, closed loop control should be used in the height positioning of the legs. This involves having a sensor in the system that could provide feedback on the state of the foot. The hexapod in \cite{Ollervides:Navigation} used miniature resistive force sensors attached to the bottom of each foot of the robot. The robot therefore has the ability to take analogue measurements from these sensors and determine the weight distribution of the individual feet of the robot. This data is used to confirm that all robot feet are making contact with the surface and correct the situation if this is not the case. This type of feedback is also useful when the robot is operated on slanted surfaces because of the effect that the center of gravity has on a slanted surface.\\

In the article \cite{MORITZ}, the development of an omnidirectional legged robot, named MORITZ, that climbs though pipe networks is discussed. Even though the configuration of this robot differs very much from the five legged robot developed in this project, there are still some common problems that could be helpful. The article discusses the importance of a planned gait pattern. In the case of MORITZ, the gait pattern is even more important because a small decrease in traction could result in the robot falling. An important note in this article, that also applies to this project, is that the calculations of forces and weight should not be done with all of the legs able to help carry the load. This is necessary for when the robot is not carrying a load while stationary, but walking/crawling. In this case the robot has to lift at least one leg at a time and  therefore the full load should be supported by the remaining legs.\\

If the servo motors implemented in the robot, built in this project, is not capable of easily lifting the robot with at least one leg free, torsional springs could be used. The article \cite{Atsushi:Design} discusses the use of torsional springs in a robot in order to keep tension on the walls of a pipe. Torsional springs are the angular equivalent of normal tension or compression springs and deliver force as a linear function of angle. The idea behind the use of these springs is that instead of the servo having to apply all of the force required all the time, the spring does a substantial part of this and the force required by the servo is significantly reduced.

\subsubsection{Application of background to this project}

%IK
Inverse kinematics as described in \cite{Oh:Analytic} is used extensively in this project because of its ability to easily transform desired Cartesian coordinates, into the required actuator angles. This method can be applied to any system with specified degrees of freedom and can therefore be simplified to solve the inverse kinematic equations for the system designed in this project.\\
%Sine pattern
The robot built in this project is not designed for  highly optimized motion in one (forward) direction, but rather with a focus on holonomic motion. This means that a complex motion planning algorithm is not really necessary since the motions will likely be short, slow and frequently varying direction. The symmetry required by the method outlined in \cite{Hidayat:Autonomous} does not exist in a robot with five legs and it is therefore not worth adapting this complex algorithm. A different, simplified scheduling technique is therefore implemented in the design of this robot. The method used will rely on information from the current position of the legs as well as the safe limits of leg movement.\\

%Motion planning
The robot discussed in \cite{Jain:Odometry} is also capable of holonomic movement. This similarity means that some of the methods discussed and applied in \cite{Jain:Odometry} can be used to aid in the design of the algorithm used in this project.\\

%Sensors
The paper \cite{Ollervides:Navigation} makes the case that a robot like this should be designed in a closed loop control system configuration. This means that some feedback information is required for making decisions as well as confirming that the motions have been executed successfully.
A feedback sensor will be included in the design of the five legged holonomic robot in this project.\\

%Slanted
If the robot is operating on a slanted surface, without it being aware of this, while the centre of gravity shifts over the lowest contact making foot, the robot could fall over even if all of its legs are making contact with the surface. In a paper on reactive robot navigation \cite{Arkin:Reactive}, it is proposed that the use of a digital inclinometer can aid in solving this problem. The sensor provides information on the current tilt of the robot in two dimensions. This sensor in combination with the feedback sensors on the robot feet can be used to ensure that the robot levels itself automatically to avoid tipping over. The data collected from this sensor can also be used to collect information on the terrain. In the journal article \cite{Arkin:Reactive}, this data is used for hill climbing as well as finding valleys in unexplored areas. In order to enable the robot designed in this project to walk on slanted surfaces, a digital inclinometer could be used. Some of the reactive navigation techniques discussed in \cite{Arkin:Reactive} could also be implemented to aid the robot in navigating on slanted planes.\\

In a paper on the effects of slippery surfaces on biped robots \cite{Hyeon:Reflex}, methods on avoiding falling over of a biped robot is investigated. Since these robots have to balance themselves, to stay upright, an unforeseen slippery patch on a surface could be fatal for the robot. If it were possible to foresee a slippery surface, slowing down the walking gait and increasing foot surface would help increase the traction of the robot and could therefore lower the risk of slipping. Since a five legged robot is inherently stable and there is no balancing required, slippery surfaces may influence the traction of the robot but there is very low risk of falling over on level surfaces that are slippery. It is therefore suitable to just slow down movements on slippery surfaces to increase the traction where possible.\\

If the robot is not able to stand properly with the chosen servo motors, torsional springs could be used similar to \cite{Atsushi:Design} to lift most of the robot's weight and reduce strain on the servo motors.\\
