The purpose of this project was to design and implement a holonomic five legged robot. Legged vehicles are preferred for exploration because they are much less likely to get stuck in unknown or uneven terrain, which is important when the vehicle is unmanned and being controlled remotely. Holonomic movement, meaning the robot is able to move in any direction from a standing position as well as being able to rotate about its own axis, means that the robot is even more capable of getting out of trouble in an unknown environment. A working model of such a robot was built making use of small servo motors and mostly 3D printed parts for the mechanical construction. The mathematics and movement algorithms were implemented on a 32 bit microcontroller. The robot is controlled with a smartphone application via Bluetooth, proving that it can be controlled remotely with a low bandwidth connection. The robot is able to walk in any direction without rotating or curving first, meaning it is capable of holonomic translation. It is also able to rotate without translating first as well as being able to cross small obstacles and walk on slanted surfaces. All of this results in a robot that can move quicker and easier through unknown terrain with a lower risk of getting stuck along the way - perfect for exploration.
