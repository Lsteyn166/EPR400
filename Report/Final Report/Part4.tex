Implementation of electronics on a PCB.& All electronics were implemented on a Veroboard instead of a PCB which is inexpensive and sufficiently robust for the purpose of this project. A PCB would not have made any functional difference to the end result and is not suited for making changes while prototyping. The only difference would have been aesthetically.& Incomplete \\\hline

Implementation of inclinometer sensor & An inclinometer was planned to give the robot the ability to adapt to the exact angle of slanted surfaces but this was not implemented because the robot walks without a problem on the angles of surfaces specified for this project. & Incomplete \\\hline

\subsubsection{Qualification tests}

%Test 1
\paragraph{Qualification test \arabic{paragraph} : Holonomic translation}
\label{par:1}
\subparagraph{Qualification test}
\textit{Objectives of test/experiment}\\
The objective is to prove that the robot is capable of moving in any direction from a standing position without first rotating.
\textit{Equipment used}\\
A canvas with lines in 30 degree increments is used to put the robot on.
\textit{Experimental parameters and setup }\\
The robot is turned on and placed in the centre of the canvas.
\textit{Experimental protocol}\\
The robot is instructed to move along one of the lines and then return to the centre by using the smartphone as remote control. Once back in the centre, the next line is followed. This process continues until all the lines have been followed.
\subparagraph{Results and observations}
\textit{Measurements}\\
Figure \ref{fig:Res1} shows the robot on the canvas where the qualification test is being performed.
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale = 1]{pics/Res1.jpg}
\caption{Top view of the robot on the canvas.}
\label{fig:Res1}
\end{figure}
\textit{Description of results}\\
The robot is able to successfully follow the lines on the canvas without ever rotating.

%Test 2
\paragraph{Qualification test \arabic{paragraph} : Rotation without translation}
\subparagraph{Qualification test}
\textit{Objectives of test/experiment}\\
The objective of this test is to confirm that the robot is capable of rotating around its own axis without translating.
\textit{Equipment used}\\
The same canvas used in \ref{par:1} is used for this qualification test. It has two circles, one has the diameter of the robot base, the second is 5\% larger.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 1]{pics/Res2.jpg}
\caption{Canvas used for this experiment.}
\label{fig:Res2}
\end{figure}
\textit{Experimental parameters and setup }\\
The robot is placed inside the smaller circle and switched on.
\textit{Experimental protocol}\\
The robot is instructed to rotate from the smartphone application. After 90 degrees of rotation, the robot is instructed to stop and is then turned off. The robot should be within the bigger circle.
\subparagraph{Results and observations}
\textit{Measurements}\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 1]{pics/Res3.jpg}
\caption{Robot inside the larger circle}
\label{fig:Res3}
\end{figure}
\textit{Description of results}\\
The robot is still inside the larger circle after rotating 90 degrees.

%Test 3
\paragraph{Qualification test \arabic{paragraph} :Speed on rough terrain}
\subparagraph{Qualification test}

\textit{Objectives of test/experiment}\\The purpose of this test is to show that the robot functions reasonably well on rough terrain when compared to a smooth surface.
\textit{Equipment used}\\
A small test track developed for this purpose is used. In order to compare performance between the smooth and rough terrain, the time to complete the track is recorded with a stopwatch application on a smartphone.
\textit{Experimental parameters and setup }\\
A rough terrain is simulated by scattering small, loose obstacles (foam blocks) over the test track. This is a realistic representation of a wide variety of terrain conditions. For preparation the robot is placed on the start line of the smooth test track and switched on. 
\textit{Experimental protocol}\\
The stopwatch is started and the robot is instructed to follow the line that forms the test track. When the robot reaches the end, the time on the stopwatch is recorded. The test track is scattered with the small obstacles and the procedure is repeated.
