\subsection{Demonstration at the examination}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The robot will be placed on a grid on the floor and the examiners will be shown that the robot is capable of holonomic movement.
\item The centre of the robot will be noted on the grid and the examiners will see that the robot is capable of rotating around its centre without translating.
\item The robot will execute a specific set of movements while the time to completion is being recorded.
\item Small obstacles will be placed in the way of the robot to make movement more challenging. This includes small blocks to step over as well as a change in surface such as sand.
\item The robot will repeat the set of movements over the obstacles while the time to completion is measured again.
\item The examiners will see that the robot is capable of moving with similar effort over various surfaces.
\end{enumerate}
