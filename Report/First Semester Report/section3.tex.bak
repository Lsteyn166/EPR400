\section{Project plan}

This section includes the planning for the complete project period which spans over the period 1 February 2017 to 30 November 2017. The planning is in the form of a Gantt chart with a one week resolution. Figure \ref{fig:Gantt1} below shows the planning for the project up to the date of handing in this report. The blocks coloured in blue therefore represent work that is already completed.\\

Figure \ref{fig:Gantt2} below shows the remaining time in the project period. The blocks coloured in purple therefore represent work that still has to be completed.
