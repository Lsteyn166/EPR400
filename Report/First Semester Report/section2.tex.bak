\section{Approach}
In order to fully constrain the system, one actuator is required for every degree of freedom in the system. The robot uses 5 identical legs spaced 72 degrees apart around a circular chassis in order to make the system holonomic. If every leg has N degrees of freedom, the robot will require $5 \times N$ actuators for it to be fully constrained\\
