\markright{Part 1. Preamble}

This report is a description of the work I completed during the year on my final year project, design of a holonomic five legged robot.

This report contains a copy of my approved project proposal and documentation on the technical parts of my project. These can be found in parts 3 and 4 respectively. The technical documentation contains a detailed recording of the steps taken to overcome design challenges. This includes circuit diagrams, algorithm flowcharts and test results. This section appears on the CD that accompanies this printed report.

This project does not build on any previous project. Instead it is a completely different approach to the holonomic exploration robot problem that was also addressed in earlier years. Although this project has a similar goal to that of previous years, it does not build on these as the locomotion is completely different.

I,\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  understand  what  plagiarism  is  and  
have  carefully  studied  the  plagiarism  policy  of  the  University.  I  
hereby declare that all the work described in this report is my own, 
except  where  explicitly  indicated 
otherwise.  Although  I  may  have  
discussed the design and investigation with my study leader, fellow 
students  or  consulted  various  books,  articles  or  the  internet,  the  
design/investigative work is my own. I have mastered the design and I 
have made all the required calculations in my lab book (and/or they are  reflected  in  this  report)  to  authenticate  this.  I  am  not  
presenting a complete solution of someone else. 
Wherever  I  have  used  information  from  other  sources,  I  have  given  
credit by proper and complete referencing of the source material so 
that  it  can  be  clearly  discerned  what  is  my  own  work  and  what  was  
quoted from other sources. I acknowledge that failure to comply with 
the   instructions   regarding   referencing   will   be   regarded   as   
plagiarism.  If there is any doubt about the authenticity of my work, 
I am willing to attend an oral ancillary examination/evaluation about 
the work. 
I  certify  that  the  Project  Proposal  appearing  as  the  Introduction  
section  of  the  report  is  a  verbatim  copy  of  the  approved  Project
Proposal. \\
